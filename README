Reusable components for Jolla harbour apps
==========================================

Some of them allow to access undocumented Sailfish OS features, some
provide compatibility with older releases of Sailfish OS. This code
has been tested against Sailfish OS 2.1 meaning that some, if not most
of it, is probably incompatible with older versions.

The easiest way to use this code in your project is to add this repo
as a git submodule to your project and add the files you need to your
.pro file.

This repository is always work in progress, don't expect any tags,
formal releases or anything like that. Although you may expect the
changes to be backward compatible.
